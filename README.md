# Repository Summary: Interactive Photo Gallery & Coding Challenges

This repository contains two main projects:


## Interactive Photo Gallery

The Interactive Photo Gallery is a project designed to display a collection of images interactively. Here's a brief overview:

### Features

- Hover Effect: Images blur and scale slightly on hover, revealing a description and a "Know more" prompt.
- Full-Size Overlay: Clicking on an image opens a full-size overlay view with the image and its description.
- Responsive Design: The gallery layout adjusts for different screen sizes for a good user experience on various devices.

For setup instructions and getting started, refer to the Gallery README.

## Coding Challenges
The COA Coding Challenges directory contains two main challenges:

### 1. Array Manipulation

This challenge involves determining if there exists a contiguous subarray within a given array of integers that sums up to a target value. Return true if such a subarray exists; otherwise, return false.

For details on the algorithm used, time and space complexity analysis, and setup instructions, refer to the Array Manipulation README.

### 2. String Transformation

This challenge involves transforming a given string based on specific rules depending on its length.

For details on the algorithm used, time and space complexity analysis, and setup instructions, refer to the String Transformation README.
